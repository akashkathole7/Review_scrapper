Review Scraper
This project is a review scraper that can be used for various purposes such as text summarization and sentiment analysis.

Installation
First, install the required packages by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the review scraper, execute the review_scraper.py file. The scraper will prompt you to enter the URL of the webpage you wish to scrape reviews from, the number of reviews to scrape, and the filename to save the results to.

Copy code
python review_scraper.py
Once the program has finished running, you will find the scraped reviews in the specified file.

Future Improvements
In future updates, we plan to add additional functionality such as the ability to scrape reviews from multiple pages and to extract additional metadata such as review ratings and dates.
